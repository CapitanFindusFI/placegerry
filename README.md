Placeholder service displaying images of Gerry Scotti our lord

Similar to [PlaceCage](https://www.placecage.com/) this project aims to realize an image placeholder service made with Gerry Scotti images taken from Google pictures.

## Run

Running the `researcher.py` file for a few minutes, it will download pictures of Gerry Scotti with a simple naming convention which is `{width}-{height}-{filename}`. After downloading a few pictures, you can run `main.py` file to start the Flask API which should be used to retrieve them
